# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

---

## Game Setup

proof that the game sets itself up properly

### Test Data To Use

the output after the setup finishes and code that proves where its doing what

### Expected Test Result

the game should fill the board with the amount of coins decided in random places, no coin should start in first slot

---

## Player Moves

the player has proper control over what they want to do and that they cant do stuff they're not meant to

### Test Data To Use

output and proof of corrections where problems happened and code that stop stuff like coins going past each other and how the player selects what they want to do

### Expected Test Result

smooth control for the player with no errors or unfair advantages
